## Introduction

Inferring knowledge from highly complex and high-dimensional data has always been a challenge in biology. Recently, deep-learning algorithms have taken the world by storm, achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks like image classification, speech recognition, language translation and object detection. Deep learning algorithms take in raw inputs defined with a set of features and give predictions for the given task based on patterns buried inside. These algorithms perform exceptionally well with a massive amount of data. Since biology is a data-rich field with complex and unstructured data, scientists can apply deep learning for almost all tasks related to biology, potentially revolutionising this field. Deep learning approaches have already improved over previous scores achieved using traditional methods in specific tasks, although the gains in some studies are modest. This method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying essential features and predicting outcomes by harnessing heterogeneity across several dimensions of natural variation. Computer-aided drug design aims to make the drug discovery process faster and cheaper. Current research focuses more on the docking and scoring part of the drug discovery pipeline. However, these methodologies already assume that the protein's binding site is already determined with high confidence. Accurate binding site detection is complex, and current methods are lacking in locating the druggable binding sites with high accuracy.

## Traditional Approaches

Traditional approaches for binding cavity detection are typically geometry-based, but there are also examples of tools using binding energy to different chemical probes, sequence conservation (template or evolutionary methods) or a combination of these. For example, the ProBiS<d-cite key="konc2010probis"></d-cite>, a similarity-based tool, uses local surface alignment with sub-residue precision, allowing us to find sites with similar physicochemical properties to the templates stored in the database. Such methods simultaneously detect binding sites and provide insight into their expected properties (they are probably similar to the templates in which they were matched :cry: :disappointed:). Other approaches rely on a two-step algorithm, in which potential pockets are first identified and then scored to select the most probable binding sites. For example, Fpocket<d-cite key="le2009fpocket"></d-cite> is a geometry-based method that finds cavities in a protein’s structure and then scores them. The reverse approach is used in P2RANK<d-cite key="krivak2018p2rank"></d-cite>, which uses a random forest (RF) model to predict the “inaudibility” score for each point on a protein’s surface and cluster points with high scores. The method discussed here developed by Stepniewska-Dziubinska, Marta M., Piotr Zielenkiewicz, and Pawel Siedlecki.<d-cite key="stepniewska2020improving"></d-cite> uses 3D convolution layers to classify each atom in the protein space, whether it belongs to a binding site or not, similar to a 3D segmentation task. Predictions can then be saved as .cmap or .cube files that can be later analyzed in molecular modelling software.


## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
  df,
  lat='Latitude',
  lon='Longitude',
  z='Magnitude',
  radius=10,
  center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
  zoom=0,
  mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
