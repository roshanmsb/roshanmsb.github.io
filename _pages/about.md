I am a budding researcher pursuing my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). My academic journey is fueled by a deep fascination for untangling the intricate mysteries of biological systems using the latest technological innovations. 

I hold a BTech in Biotechnology from NIT Calicut and am thrilled to contribute to the academic community as a member of the BioSystems Engineering and Control group at IIT Madras. My research primarily delves into the exciting realms of multi-modal artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, all focusing on their applications within biological modalities. My work has the potential to advance scientific understanding and impact vital areas like industrial biotechnology and drug development.

Beyond my research pursuits, I am committed to sharing knowledge and nurturing the future generation of AI and biology enthusiasts. With an insatiable curiosity, I am dedicated to making meaningful contributions at the exciting crossroads of AI and biology.
